# Building Information Management System (C++)

This C++ program manages and analyzes information about various building centers, such as residential, commercial, and official properties.  
It allows users to input details including the name, address, construction date, type of building, number of people, price per square meter, and the number of units.  

**Key Features**:
- **Data Entry**: Collects details for multiple buildings.
- **Filtering**: Counts the number of commercial centers with more than 500 people.
- **Oldest Building Detection**: Finds and displays the oldest building in the dataset.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Counts residential buildings with more than 1000 people and names longer than 10 characters.
- **Data Display**: Outputs details for all buildings in a structured format.

This project demonstrates the use of:
- **Structures (`struct`)** to organize related data.
- **Enumerations (`enum`)** to classify building types.
- **Functions** for clean and reusable code.
- **Basic loops and conditions** to process and filter data.

Perfect for learning how to handle structured data and perform simple data analysis in C++.
